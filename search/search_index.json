We run Lua code using native Lua, so your Lua script will run anywhere from 100 - 10,000 times faster than with plugins like Moonsharp ! Try our benchmarks yourself here . bLua is made specifically for Unity projects, so there are no extra steps for getting Lua integrated. Simply clone the bLua repository into your /Assets/Plugins/bLua folder. bLua also runs on the latest Lua (5.4), which is faster and has more features than other Lua plugins. Join our community on Discord ! Discord Contributors Tyster actively maintains and upgrades bLua so it can power Lua scripts in over 2,500 user-created World to Build games. Denivarius and the team at DMHub created the original native Lua interop that became bLua and actively assist in the development of new features.","title":"Blua"},{"location":"blua/#what-is-blua","text":"bLua is a plugin for Unity that allows C# code to easily interact with native Lua 5.4.
